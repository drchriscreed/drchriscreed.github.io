Have you ever encountered an accessibility overlay when browsing the web? These tools have become increasingly prevalent and are used by some companies in an attempt to enhance accessibility for disabled users. 

However, their effectiveness is a subject of considerable debate within the accessibility community. 

Accessibility overlays are third-party solutions that modify a website’s presentation, typically offering features to adjust font size, colour, and other visual elements. 

The idea is to allow users to adapt the design to their own specific needs to create a more accessible experience. Some well-known examples include <a href="#">accessiBe</a>, <a href="#">AudioEye</a>, <a href="#">UserWay</a>, and <a href="#">EqualWeb</a>. 

Despite their potential benefits, these overlays have been met with significant criticism. Accessibility experts have argued that they fail to address the core needs of disabled users and actually introduce new accessibility challenges. 

Until recently, however, there was a lack of empirical research exploring user experiences with these tools. 

To address this gap, researchers at Technological University Dublin and Rochester Institute of Technology recently published a study focusing on blind and low vision users’ perspectives of accessibility overlays (<a href="#">The Promise and Pitfalls of Web Accessibility Overlays for Blind and Low Vision Users</a>). 

They conducted a survey with 47 individuals with visual impairments, followed by 12 in-depth interviews to gain deeper insights into their experiences. 

The results were interesting and highlighted some key concerns: 

<ol>
  <li>
  The majority of participants reported that the accessibility overlays they experienced were not beneficial and often exacerbated accessibility issues. 
  </li>

  <li>Specific problems included:
    <ul>
      <li>Increased difficulty in website navigation</li>
      <li>The overlay’s screen reader interfering with users’ primary screen readers</li> 
      <li>Lack of keyboard accessibility within overlay tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Participants noted that overlays tend to focus on “surface-level” visual adjustments (e.g., text size and colour contrast), which users with visual impairments will often already manage at the operating system level.</li>

  <li>Interestingly, the presence of an overlay negatively impacted users’ perceptions of the main website, leading them to assume the site was likely inaccessible as well.</li>

</ol>

While the general feedback was predominantly negative, it’s worth noting that participants did not entirely dismiss the potential of this approach. They highlighted that overlays could be valuable if developed with a more thorough understanding of user requirements and designed accordingly. 

However, this research strongly suggests that the current implementation of accessibility overlays is falling short for this particular audience. There was a clear preference among participants for websites to be designed with accessibility in mind from the outset, rather than relying on solutions that are “bolted” onto existing sites and applications. 

This reiterates a longstanding call within the accessibility community - to adopt inclusive design practices that consider diverse user needs from the beginning of the development process. 

This approach is more likely to result in genuinely inclusive and accessible web experiences, as opposed to taking “short-cuts” that attempt to apply “sticky tape” to accessibility issues.
